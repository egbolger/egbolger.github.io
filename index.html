    Welcome! I am a PhD Student in the <a href="https://cmse.msu.edu/">Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (CMSE) Department</a> at Michigan State University. I currently work in the <a href="https://msu-cerl.github.io/">Computational Education Research Lab (CERL)</a> where we focus on understanding how students learn computational science and related tools, so that we can improve our teaching strategies. Outside of research, I am a teaching assistant for CMSE 381: Fundamentals of Data Science Methods. I am also passionate about outreach and mentoring young individuals interested in STEM.

<!-- In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
